        <p>
            Cleveland PyLadies is an open and inclusive Python user group
            explicitly focused on engaging women and underrepresented populations in tech,
            specifically in and around Northeast Ohio. We are a local chapter of the global
            Pyladies organization.

        <p>
            We understand that work schedules, motherhood, transportation,
            and many other factors can act as a barrier for many women
            that otherwise would love to engage with local tech communities.
            Because of this, we aim to stream ~30 minute chunks of our meetups
            to facilitate participation of PyLadies that are not able to make
            a meeting in person.

        <p>
            Many of our members are new to Python, so we curate playlists
            of educational videos and tutorials.
